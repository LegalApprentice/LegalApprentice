# What Problem Do We Solve?

The complex claim resolutions process is a large, difficult and costly problem for many industries.

These organizations are overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of claims they must process.  This leads to huge backlogs and unhappy customers.  

The Legal Apprentice Platform reduces the cost of processing claims.  We use AI.  We can automate resolution of simpler claims and provide decision support for adjusters who process more difficult claims. This will save you money, and make your customers happy.

Our team of part time volunteers and open source contributors has made significant progress on the complex example, PTSD claims for veterans.

We can complete this proof of concept much more quickly with your open source contributions to this project or through introductions to people who have a need to process claims.
